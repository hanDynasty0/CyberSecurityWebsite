        <h1>Malware: For Real Though</h1>
        <p>"Malware" (short for malicious software) is computer software that can be used by hackers and cyber criminals to breach someone's data without permission. Malware can also damage computer systems by deleting or altering crucial files, send the computer unwanted advertisements, or even cripple the hardware components that allow a computer to function.</p>
        <h2>How does malware get in a computer?</h2>
        <p>Malware can get onto a computer from malicious files on deceptive emails (phishing) or websites, external devices (USBs, external hard drives, etc.) or through computer networks.</p>
      </div>
      <div id = "types">
        <h2>Some Types of Malware</h2>
        <h3>Virus</h3>
          <p>Similar to the biological agent that causes infections, a computer virus works by copying its own malicious code to files or programs on the computer, using the now infected files and/or programs to replicate. In the worst case scenario, the computer will crash, and other common symptoms of a computer being infected by a virus include the slowing down of apps and the opening of multiple pop-up windows due to the virus infecting files crucial for the computer to run. 
          </p>
        <h3>Worms</h3>
          <p>Worms are a form of malware that self-replicates continuously in order to slow and eventually crash a computer system. Worms can also carry other forms of malware such as spyware that can collect data from your computer or cause further damage to the computer. Unlike other forms of malware, worms can spread to other devices sharing the same WiFi network, or through weak software security on other devices.
          </p>
        <h3>Spyware</h3>
          <p>Spyware is, no surprise, malware that hackers use to spy on other people's computers and what activities occur on those computers. Spyware can screen capture images of what is happening on a computer monitor or keep track of the keys being punched on a keyboard to collect data. The data collected from spyware can then be sent back to the hacker.</p>
        <h3>Ransomware</h3>
          <p>Ransomware is a form of malware that blocks a user from accessing their data or device until a sum of money (usually in the form of some cryptocurrency) is paid to the hacker. Ransomware does this by either encrypting a computer's data or by rendering a device unusable through the use of pop-ups or other means. The ransomware then gives the user a ransom note through a text file or pop-up informing the victim of how much money they will need to pay in order to restore the device to its original state. </p>
        <h3>Adware</h3>
         <p>Adware is a program that generates advertisements onto your computer, which allows the developer or hacker that generates the ads to make ad revenue. Some adware tracks the user's browsing history and searches to generate ads that are more tailored to the user. Not all adware is malicious, however annoying or excessive ads may be. However, hackers can use adware to advertise websites or programs containing malware, or simply flood a computer with ad pop-ups in order to farm a lot of ad revenue. </p>
        <h3>Trojan Horse</h3>
          <p>In cybersecurity, Trojan Horses are similar to the Trojan Horse of Greek Mythology in that the Horse disguises a piece of malware as a legit program. If the Trojan Horse is activated, the malware hidden in the Horse will harm the computer it is on. Depending on the malware in the Trojan, the malware could let a hacker gain remote access to a computer, steal a user's account details, act as spyware or ransomware, or download other malwares to bombard the computer.</p>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Read fine print when downloading new software</li>
          <li>Download only well-known and trusted softwares</li>
          <li>Watch out for phishing emails</li>
          <li>Don't click on ad pop-ups</li>
          <li>Scan external devices such as USB sticks before opening programs in them</li>
          <li>Download anti-malware software from trusted sites</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How Anti-Malware Software Works</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Uses a database of malware "signatures" to detect malware</li>
          <li>Also uses heuristics, which analyzes a program's behaviour</li>
          <li>Can also use Artificial Intelligence to help detect malware behaviour</li>
          <li>Once the anti-malware software detects malware, the anti-malware will immediately stop the malware's program and might automatically delete the malware depending on the anti-malware software's programming</li>
        </ul>
