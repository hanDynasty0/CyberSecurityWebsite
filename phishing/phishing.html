        Phishing happens when a hacker sends someone an email seemingly from a legitimate company asking for sensitive
        information, such as bank account and credit card details. Once this information is acquired, the hacker or
        phisher can use it to access your bank account and spend money from it, taking over your account and making you
        lose a lot of money. So please, don't give away your email so easily.

        Hackers can obtain emails by making fake websites with email signups (a good example being newsletter signup
        prompts), but they can also harvest emails from websites by invoking the "@" symbol, manipulate people to give
        their email addresses through human interaction (this is called social engineering), or even enter the
        <strong>Dark Web</strong> (the Internet's underworld) to buy lists of email addresses.

        To protect yourself from phishing attacks, you should <em>actually read</em> the terms and conditions statement
        on any site which uses your information. This will inform you about what the website typically does with
        information they collect. You also shouldn't leave your email on display on random websites, as hackers can then
        harvest that information easily. Using burner email accounts for newsletters and when sending emails is another
        good idea to foil phishers. Burner accounts are essentially temporary accounts that are "burned" or deleted once
        they are used so that your personal, real information remains hidden from any trackers used on any website,
        including newsletters and potential phishers.
