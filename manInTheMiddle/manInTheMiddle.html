        <h2>What is a Man-In-The-Middle Attack?</h2>

        <p>Man-In-The-Middle attacks are essentially hackers eavesdropping on information being transferred in a computer network. There are various strategies that a hacker can use to intercept data. These generally fall into two broad categories: <br></p>
        <h3>Spoofing</h3>
        <p>Spoofing involves tricking the user into revealing information by mimicking a trustable WiFi network, website, or other such system. Note that phishing might also involve spoofed websites.</p>

        <h3>Hijacking</h3>
        <p>Hijacking would be directly gaining access to one end of an information transfer in order to obtain the desired data. For example, hackers can hijack email accounts or cookies on websites, or even a WiFi network.</p>

        <h2>Basic Ways to Avoid Man-In-The-Middle Attacks</h2>
        <h3>Avoid Free Public WiFi</h3>
        <p>It really is frustrating when you are outside and can't access the Internet. But it is best not to connect to any conveniently free WiFi networks. You never know if any of these WiFi networks were made by hackers to observe your online activity and login credentials that you enter while on the free WiFi. </p>
        <h3>Use HTTPS websites over HTTP websites</h3>
        <p>There are usually some grey letters like "https://" or "http://". at the beginning of a website address. These letters are actually important for you to know if a website is secure. HTTP is an acronym that stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol", which allows for the transfer of information on a website. HTTPS websites are essentially HTTP websites but with added encryption and security, which means hackers can't see any data being transferred on an https website. This is because HTTPS uses a security protocol known as "SSL" or "TLS". HTTP, on the other hand, does not have this security protocol, meaning that hackers can track what a user does on an HTTP website. So next time you go on a website, pay attention to the four letters in light gray at the beginning of each website address.</p>

        <h3>Use a VPN</h3>
        <p>A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, works by sending the information you send to websites to a special VPN server, where the information is encrypted and then sent to the website you are on. This way, all information that your computer sends to websites is encrypted, meaning that hackers won't be able to understand anything they intercept in a man-in-the-middle attack. Some VPNs also block malicious websites and ad pop-ups, essentially acting as an anti-malware software. Examples of VPNs include NordVPN, ExpressVPN and SurfShark (logos are pictured below).</p>

        <h3>Use a strong WiFi password</h3>
        <p>It is really hard to hijack a WiFi network and gain access to a user's online activity through the router if the WiFi network has a strong password.
